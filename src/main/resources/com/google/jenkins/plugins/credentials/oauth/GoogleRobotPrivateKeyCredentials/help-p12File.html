   This is the "...-privatekey.p12" file associated with the service account credential in the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/console">Google Cloud Console</a>.  A new private key may be generated for a service account if you no longer have the original.
   <p/>
   To create a new service account:
   <ul>
     <li>Select your project from the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/console">list</a>.</li>
     <li>Navigate to "APIs & Auth" and then "Credentials"</li>

     <li>Click the big red "CREATE NEW CLIENT ID" button</li>
     <li>Select "Service account" and click "Create Client ID".</li>
     <li>A dialog should pop-up to download the private key file for the new service account, save this in a secure location.  <b>This is the file you must upload here.</b></li>
   </ul>

   To generate a new key for an existing service account, follow the above instructions until the "CREATE NEW CLIENT ID" step and instead find the Service Account for which you need a new key and click "Generate new key".
